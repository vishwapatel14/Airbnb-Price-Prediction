# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict Airbnb listing prices to assist hosts in setting competitive rates and guests in assessing the fairness of their stays. The analysis provides insights into key factors influencing pricing and highlights opportunities for hosts to optimize their listings.

**Note that the dataset csv included on this repository contains only the first 100 rows of data, due to size constraints.**

### Multiple Linear Regression
- All variables included due to infeasibility of forward stepwise selection.
- Achieved an **RÂ² of 79.9%**, explaining most of the variation in log prices.
- **Train/Test RMSE**:
  - Train: 0.295 ($68.29)
  - Test: 0.343 ($80.46)
